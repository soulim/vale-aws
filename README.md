# AWS style for Vale CLI _(vale-aws)_

A style for Vale prose linter.

## What is Vale?

Vale is a syntax-aware linter for prose built with speed and extensibility in mind.

Unlike most writing-related software, Vale's primary purpose isn't to provide its own advice; it's designed to enforce an existing style guide through its YAML-based extension system.

Vale uses a plain-text (INI and YAML) configuration system that makes it possible to share configurations across platforms, applications, and users.
